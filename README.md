# Risk Scoring System

Build a risk scoring system that:
1. Takes business data (credit score, revenue, time in business, industry)
2. Calculates a risk score (0-100)
3. Returns a risk tier (Low/Medium/High)
4. Explains WHY the score was given

The catch: Scoring rules change frequently based on:
- Market conditions (conservative vs aggressive)
- Industry (restaurants are riskier than tech)
- Loan size (small vs large loans have different criteria)
